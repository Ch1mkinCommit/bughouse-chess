  <h1>About bughouse.pro</h1>
  <p>
    Welcome to bughouse.pro: a place where you can play bughouse chess online with your friends!
  </p>
  <!-- TODO: Make more readable by adding visual structure. -->
  <p>
    <i>Bughouse chess</i> (a.k.a. double chess, exchange chess, tandem chess, etc.)
    is a chess variant played two versus two on two boards.
    Pieces captured by one player go into their teammate's <i>reserve</i>.
    Each player has an option to <i>drop</i> a reserve piece on a free square instead
    of making a <s>boring</s> normal chess move.
  </p>
  <p>
    There are variations in bughouse chess rules, and this site aims to support them all
    rather than one specific variant. For example, it allows you to configure where pawns
    can be dropped or whether drops with checkmates are allowed. Here you even could
    (I dare say: should) play bughouse Fischer random chess! I find this to be a particularly
    neat combination: bughouse effectively makes endgame theory useless and Fischer random
    does the same to openings. Together they let your imagination fly completely free from
    the chains of chess textbooks.

  <p>
    If you cherish a bughouse variant that we missed, if you feel your experience on this
    website is not crazy enough&nbsp— please tell us! Our aim is to make bughouse chess do
    justice to its name.

    Please note that this platform is in beta. Features may be missing. Games may crash.
    Rating may be recalculated retroactively. If you encounter something that feels like
    a bug&nbsp— please tell us!
  </p>
  <p>
    The two biggest missing features are built-in player communication and matchmaking.
    For now there's really just one way to play bughouse here. First, find a group of
    people willing to play bughouse. Second, organize yourself a call in a voice chat of
    your choosing. Third, create a game here, send an invitation code to your fellow
    players and enjoy!
