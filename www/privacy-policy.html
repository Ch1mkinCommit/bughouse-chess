  <h2>What information do we collect?</h2>
  <p><b>Personal information provided by you.</b> This includes your

  <p><b>Automatically collected information.</b> This includes service
      usage data, performance statistics and basic information about your system (such as your OS and browser version).
      It also includes information that allows us to estimate your location (such as IP address and timezone), but it
      does not include precise location information (such as GPS data).</p>
  <p>Please note that your game history is considered public information and is out of scope
      of this policy.</p>
  <h2>How do we use your information?</h2>

  <h2>How long do we keep your information?</h2>

      services.</p>
  <p>When we have no ongoing business need to process your personal information, we will
      delete or anonymize such information, or, if this is not feasible (for example, because your information is stored
