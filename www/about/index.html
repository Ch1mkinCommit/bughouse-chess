  </h1>
  <p>
    Welcome to bughouse.pro: a free, adless, open-source bughouse chess server!
  </p>
  <p>
    <i>Bughouse chess</i> (a.k.a. double chess, exchange chess, tandem chess) is
    a chess variant played two versus two on two boards. Pieces captured by one
    player go into their teammate's <i>reserve</i>. Each player has the option
    to <i>drop</i> a reserve piece on a free square instead of making a
    <s>boring</s> normal chess move.
  </p>
  <p>
    There are variations in bughouse chess rules, and we aim to support them
    all. Whether dropping with a checkmate is allowed, whether pawns can be
    dropped one move away from promotion, whether a promoted pawn simply turns
    into a new piece or steals a piece from the other board&nbsp— all of this
    and more is configurable. On top of that, we support the following chess
    variants:
  </p>
  <!-- TODO: Replace bullets with variant icons -->
  <ul>
    <li>
      <i>Fischer random (Chess960).</i> Pawns start as usual, while other pieces
      are shuffled randomly. We believe that this variant combines particularly
      well with bughouse: while bughouse makes endgame theory obsolete, Fischer
      random does the same to openings. Together, they let your imagination fly
      free from the chains of chess textbooks.
    </li>
    <li>
      <i>Accolade.</i> Combine a Knight with a Bishop, a Rook or a Queen to get
      a Cardinal, an Empress or an Amazon respectively.
    </li>
    <li>
      <i>Duck chess.</i> A duck occupies one square on the board and cannot be
      captured. Players move the duck to a new location after each move.
    </li>
    <li>
      <i>Fog of war (Dard chess).</i> You only see squares where your pieces can
      legally move.
    </li>
    <li>
      <i>Koedem.</i> Kings can be captured. The game ends when one team
      accumulates all four kings.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    All these variants can be combined without limits. Have you ever wondered
    what it would feel like to play bughouse duck chess in fog of war? You’ve
    come to the right place! (Alternatively, if you have not wondered that, you
    might still be in the right place, because you really don't have to do
    that.)
  </p>
  <p>
    We aim to add more options in the future. If you cherish a bughouse variant
    that we missed, if you feel your experience on this website is not crazy
    enough&nbsp— please tell us. Our goal is to make bughouse chess do justice
    to its name.
