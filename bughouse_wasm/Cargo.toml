# The `console_error_panic_hook` crate provides better debugging of panics by

# all the `std::fmt` and `std::panicking` infrastructure, so isn't great for
# code size when deploying.

# Improvement potential: Optimize WASM version for size. This is blocked on the following:
#   - profiles can only be specified in the Cargo workspace root (not here);
#   - we don't want this to affect server build;
#   - wasm-pack cannot use custom cargo profiles: https://github.com/rustwasm/wasm-pack/issues/1111
# [profile.release]
# opt-level = "s"  # optimize for small code size

wasm-opt = ['-O4', '-g']  # add '-g'; workaround for https://github.com/rustwasm/wasm-pack/issues/797
